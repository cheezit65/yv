Installed rails_refactor to rename bunce controller. Ran Bundle update to update all gems & upload to Heroku to make sure this update works.

Added controller vector - remember to run rake db:migrate on heroku).
Then copied controller bounce file into vector bounce file.
Then went & replaced all necessary files with vector.
I test uploaded the new package and it was okay on the web, but i had trouble viewing it locally when i went to view a horse. Not sure if it was because of the aws link now or not.
I removed controller bounce.

I added scaffold dwnld & put any code in the views download into the views dwnld.
Then another search/replace.
Then I uploaded the package and checked it. I also ran heroku run rake db:migrate. Website is still stable.
Then I modified the dwnlds page to say what it should say.
--Then I added the recaptcha. This caused a problem locally. I had to set up for multiple uses of recaptcha in the messages_controller:

I added the if params[:user] part and the else to redirect to dwnlds_url.

    if verify_recaptcha
      if params[:user1]
        EmailPage.email_friend(params[:user1][:email1],params[:user2][:email2], params[:id], params[:yearling], params[:hip]).deliver
        flash[:notice] = "Email Sent to your friend at #{params[:user2][:email2]} "
        redirect_back(fallback_location: root_path)
      else
        redirect_to dwnlds_url
      end
    
    else
      flash[:notice] = "Captcha checkbox not checked. Try again."
      redirect_back(fallback_location: root_path)

    end
    
    Almost worked. The recaptcha was on the dwnld page but also the download page was visible. I put this in the dwnld controller:
    
    def index
  		recaptcha_tags
	end
	This didn't work so I took it out.
	

Evan wants to know if video.js is up to date.
heroku rake db:migrate (not sure if we need this done.)

I fixed the recaptcha on the dwnlds page. I'd really like to redirect it to another page that is undiscoverable, like dwnlds2 or something.

Messages controller:
  def create
    
    if verify_recaptcha
      if params[:user1]
        EmailPage.email_friend(params[:user1][:email1],params[:user2][:email2], params[:id], params[:yearling], params[:hip]).deliver
        flash[:notice] = "Email Sent to your friend at #{params[:user2][:email2]} "
        redirect_back(fallback_location: root_path)
      else
        flash[:notice] = "Verified"
        redirect_back(fallback_location: root_path)
      end
    
    else
      flash[:notice] = "Captcha checkbox not checked. Try again."
      redirect_back(fallback_location: root_path)

    end
  end
  
  dwnlds index page:
  
  <style>
table, th, td {
    border: 1px solid black;
}
 #my_popup{
	text-align: center !important;
	padding-top:1%;
	height: 400px;

	position: relative; 
	vertical-align: middle; 
}
</style>

<% else %>		

  Now having problems getting the video to download.

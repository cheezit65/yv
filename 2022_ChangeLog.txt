Installed rails_refactor to rename bunce controller. Ran Bundle update to update all gems & upload to Heroku to make sure this update works.

Added controller vector - remember to run rake db:migrate on heroku).
Then copied controller bounce file into vector bounce file.
Then went & replaced all necessary files with vector.
I test uploaded the new package and it was okay on the web, but i had trouble viewing it locally when i went to view a horse. Not sure if it was because of the aws link now or not.
I removed controller bounce.

I added scaffold dwnld & put any code in the views download into the views dwnld.
Then another search/replace.
Then I uploaded the package and checked it. I also ran heroku run rake db:migrate. Website is still stable.
Then I modified the dwnlds page to say what it should say.
--Then I added the recaptcha. This caused a problem locally. I had to set up for multiple uses of recaptcha in the messages_controller:

I added the if params[:user] part and the else to redirect to dwnlds_url.

    if verify_recaptcha
      if params[:user1]
        EmailPage.email_friend(params[:user1][:email1],params[:user2][:email2], params[:id], params[:yearling], params[:hip]).deliver
        flash[:notice] = "Email Sent to your friend at #{params[:user2][:email2]} "
        redirect_back(fallback_location: root_path)
      else
        redirect_to dwnlds_url
      end
    
    else
      flash[:notice] = "Captcha checkbox not checked. Try again."
      redirect_back(fallback_location: root_path)

    end
    
    Almost worked. The recaptcha was on the dwnld page but also the download page was visible. I put this in the dwnld controller:
    
    def index
  		recaptcha_tags
  		
  		
  		
  		
  		
  		
  		
  		
  		<!-- <style>

 #my_popup{
	text-align: center !important;
	padding-top:1%;
	height: 400px; 
	width: 400px; 
	visibility: visible; 
	display: none; 
	outline: none; 
	background-color: #4F5458 !important;
	text-align: center !important; 
	position: relative; 
	vertical-align: middle; 
}
</style>
<p><%= flash[:notice] %></p> -->

<% if not flash[:notice]== "Verified" %>	
		<button  class="my_popup_open" id="button1" style="background: linear-gradient(#00bfff, #4267b2);">Show Horse Downloads</button><br> </br> 
<!-- 
	<% @email = "" %> 
	<div id="my_popup">
 			<button onclick="window.close()"; style="margin-bottom:30px; border: thick 2px black;" class="my_popup_close">Close</button>
 			<%= form_for @very, url: {controller: "messages", action: "create"} do |f| %>
			<br><span style="font-size:16px;color: white;">
			Show Download Page<br></span>
			<span style="font-size:18px;text-align:center !important;color:black">
			<%= f.hidden_field :dwnloadID, :value => "Hubba" %>
			<%= recaptcha_tags %>
			<%= submit_tag "Send", :very => :very %> </span>			 
			<span>				
		<% if flash[:notice] %>
			<div>
				<%= flash[:notice] %>
			</div>
			<% end %>
		<% end %>
	</div> -->
	<!-- <%= recaptcha_tags %> -->
	end
	This didn't work so I took it out.
	
	

Evan wants to know if video.js is up to date.
heroku rake db:migrate (not sure if we need this done.)
